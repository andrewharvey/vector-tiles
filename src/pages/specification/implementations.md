## Implementations

Implementations of the Mapbox Vector Tile Specification are far and wide. Many of them fall into one of the following categories:

* Parsers & generators: libraries that read and/or encode vector tiles, some also have command line utilities
* Clients: web-based tools that render vector tiles that conform to the specification
* Applications: browser-based tools for creating and visualizing vector tiles
* Servers: support rendering and serving up vector tiles (*note: the specification doesn't go into how to do this explicitly*)

Visit [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles/) for a list of tools implementing vector tiles.
