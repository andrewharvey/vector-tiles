A specification is an important means of setting standards around how data is stored and encoded. Just like applications make assumptions about what information exist in a database, Mapbox tools make assumptions about how vector tiles store geographic information. The Mapbox Vector Tile Specification explicitly provides information about file formats & extensions, projections and bounds, and the internal structure of vector tiles. This page includes:

1. explanations of version distinctions
1. examples of geometry encoding
1. examples of attribute encoding
1. an explanation of the importance of winding order
1. a list of concepts *not* included in the specification
